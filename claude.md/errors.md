1- when i login then it take me back to root page of website "/" then when i click on the username in the dashboard it takes me to "/login" page even though i loged in succefully already. in file src/app/profile/page.tsx it says  * This page lets authenticated users edit their profile.
 * It's protected by <ProtectedRoute> which redirects to /login
 * if the user isn't authenticated." it should take me to user profile page instead of login page.

 2- when i check the website there is no session storage.
